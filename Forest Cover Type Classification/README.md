\# Forest Cover Type Classification



This project predicts the \*\*type of forest cover\*\* based on cartographic and environmental features using machine learning techniques.  



\## Dataset

\- \*\*Source\*\*: \[Covertype Dataset (UCI Repository)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype)  

\- Features include elevation, slope, soil type, wilderness area, and other environmental variables.  

\- The target variable is the forest cover type (multi-class classification).  



\## Project Workflow

1\. \*\*Data Preprocessing\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Handle categorical features (e.g., one-hot encoding for soil type \& wilderness areas).  

&nbsp;  - Normalize/scale continuous features.  

&nbsp;  - Handle missing values if present.  



2\. \*\*Model Training\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Train and evaluate multiple classification models.  

&nbsp;  - Compare performance across algorithms.  



3\. \*\*Evaluation\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Visualize confusion matrix.  

&nbsp;  - Analyze feature importance.  



\## Key Results

\- Built multi-class classification models to predict forest cover type.  

\- Identified most influential features contributing to prediction.  



\## Future Improvements

\- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.  

\- Try ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost).  

\- Deploy as a web app for interactive prediction.
